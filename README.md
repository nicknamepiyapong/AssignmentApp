# Project Title

This Project is Assignment for Test the applicant Job Frontend Developer (React Native)

## Description

This React-native project is not pure HTML, CSS, but rather mixed with React-native elements, 
because actually  React Native the lack of DOM, React Native doesn’t use tags like: div, section, span, input, etc. 
But don’t worry, almost every HTML tag has an equivalent React Native component, 
so we are able to use the same mindset of the web to develop with React Native components View, Text, TextInput.
